		<DocHeader id="what-is-flow">What is Flow?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Flow is a free and open-source personal finance tracking app. As Flow is offline, you are in
			control of your data.
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="where-do-i-download-flow">Where do I download Flow?</DocHeader>

		<p>You can download Flow from:</p>
		<br />
		<FlexDownloadButtons />
		<br />

		<DocHeader id="can-i-export-all-of-my-data">Can I export all of my data?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Yes, you can export JSON/ZIP backups which you can import it to another device, and CSV files
			for analyzing your data in spreadsheet software (i.e., Excel, Google Sheets), which is not
			recoverable like JSON/ZIP backups.
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="importing-erased-my-data-how-to-recover">
			Importing erased my data, how to recover?
		</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Flow does a precaution backup before starting to import. You can find the backup in <b
				>Profile tab &gt; Backup &gt; Backup history</b
			>.
		</p>
		<br />
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>Please note that the precaution isn't guaranteed to succeed</li>
			<li>
				Also iOS clears the temporary storage periodically, so you may find the backup file deleted
				if too much time has passed.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<DocHeader id="does-flow-have-online-sync">Does Flow have online sync?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			If you have Flow 0.14.0 or later on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, you can use iCloud. This required iCloud Drive sync to
			be enabled on your device. This feature does not support multiple devices syncing. Flow will attempt to save your
			manual backups to your iCloud Drive too.

			<br />

			If you have Android, Windows, or Linux, it's not available at the moment. It's planned, and may take some time to
			be ready for use. I recommend doing periodic backups to avoid data loss.
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="why-icloud-sync-isnt-working">Why iCloud sync isn't working?</DocHeader>

		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>Ensure you've logged into your Apple Account on your device (in System Settings, not on Flow)</li>
			<li>Ensure you've enabled iCloud Drive sync in System Settings &gt; Apple Account &gt; iCloud &gt; iCloud Drive &gt; Sync this iPhone (or your device's name)</li>
			<li>Ensure you've allowed Flow to access iCloud inSystem Settings &gt; Apple Account &gt; iCloud &gt; iCloud Drive &gt; Apps Syncing to iCloud Drive</li>
			<li>Flow refuses to upload the backup if it's older than the current file on iCloud. You may want to check your device's date and time settings.</li>
		</ul>

		<DocHeader id="does-flow-work-offline">Does Flow work offline?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Yes, but there are some occurances where Flow might use internet connection. Here are few examples:
		</p>
		<br/>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>Downloading exchange rates information (only if you use more than one currencies)</li>
			<li>Clicking on buttons that lead to external internet resource (Discord, GitHub, etc.)</li>
		</ul>

		<DocHeader id="does-flow-support-multi-currency">Does Flow support multi-currency</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Yes. Flow can generate reports, summaries involving accounts with different currency.
			<br />
			Reports are always displayed in your primary currency.
			<br />
			<span class="opacity-60"
				>Cross-currency transfers are available on version 0.13.0 and later</span
			>
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="can-i-make-transfers-between-different-currency-accounts">
			Can I make transfers between different currency accounts?
		</DocHeader>

		<p>Yes. Requires Flow version 0.13.0 or later</p>

		<DocHeader id="is-flow-free">Is Flow free?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			Yes, Flow is absolutely free. All of the features are available for free without any
			limitations. Please consider supporting if you can as I make Flow on the side, and does not
			generate money off of it ^^
		</p>
		<br />
		{@render beggingEntry()}

		<DocHeader id="how-many-accounts-can-i-have-at-max"
			>How many accounts can I have at max?</DocHeader
		>

		You can have as many accounts as you want.

		<DocHeader id="i-dont-find-x-features-will-it-be-implemented">
			I don't find X features, will it be implemented?
		</DocHeader>

		<p>
			If you have ideas to make Flow better, please submit it to our GitHub
			<a href="https://github.com/flow-mn/flow/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>. As long as
			it aligns with Flow's vision, it will be implemented.
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="why-is-flow-free-and-or-open-source"
			>Why is Flow free and/or open-source?</DocHeader
		>

		<p>
			Many benefit from open source, including me. And this is my small contribution. Please
			consider supporting if you can as I make Flow on the side, and does not generate money off of
			it ^^
		</p>

		<DocHeader id="can-i-add-recurring-transactions">Can I add recurring transactions?</DocHeader>

		<p>Recurring transactions feature is available on Flow 0.14.0 or later.</p>

		<DocHeader id="how-does-icloud-sync-work">How does iCloud sync work?</DocHeader>

		<p>
			This section is not specific to Flow.<br/><br />

			TL;DR Flow saves to iCloud, and the operating system uploads the file. This process cannot be sped up, or altered.<br /><br />

			Enabling iCloud sync on Flow will not immediately upload the data to iCloud. The operating system decides when it gets
			uploaded, and the decision is affected by many factors, including network connection, battery level, time of the day,
			and so on. This is not official Apple documentation, so you should refer to Apple's documentation for more accurate
			information.<br /><br />

			Interestingly enough, you don't need an internet connection for Flow to save to iCloud.
