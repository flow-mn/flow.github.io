    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flow</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 17, 2025</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Flow, a personal finance app developed by Batmend Ganbaatar
      ("we", "us", or "our"), handles your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Flow does <strong>not collect</strong>, transmit, or store any personal information. All your
      dataâ€”including preferences, settings, and saved contentâ€”is stored locally on your device. We
      do not have access to this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the App may make secure HTTPS requests to external services (such as to fetch
      exchange rates or load contributor information). These requests may result in some
      metadataâ€”such as your deviceâ€™s IP address or request headersâ€”being shared with those
      third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      Because Flow does not collect any personal information, we do not use any personal data for
      analytics, marketing, or any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal data to third parties. Since we do not collect
      your data, there is nothing to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note for Apple Users:</strong> If you're using Flow on macOS or iOS, your local data
      may be included in iCloud backups. We do not control or access iCloud data. Please refer to
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Appleâ€™s Privacy Policy</a> for
      more information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to help protect any information you store within the App. However, as
      with any software, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for keeping your
      device and data secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Flow makes HTTPS requests to third-party services to provide specific features, such as
      retrieving currency exchange rates or listing project contributors. These third-party services
      may receive technical metadata like your IP address, browser or OS type, or request headers.
      We do not control how these services handle that data. Please refer to their respective
      privacy policies for details.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page,
      along with the updated effective date. Your continued use of the App after such changes
      constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
